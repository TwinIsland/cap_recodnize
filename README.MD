# Crack_CAPTCHA

> This program can generate the CAPTCHAâ€™s recognize model which can be used to crack other. Actually, you can also called it CAPTCHA cracking model generator



## Which kind of CAPTCHA can it crack

The CAPTCHA code which **ONLY** contain the vocabulary

![](doc/cap_code.jpg)  



## How it work

1. generate some CAPTCHA code though `generator.py`, and write the data into `DB.db`
2. clean the code and split the letter by `clean.py`
3. train the model and reconstruct the data in `train.py`
4. main program located in `get_model.py`

the **arithmetic** use to cluster is `the normal KNN`



## How to use it

start the `get_model.py`, and input the `number of code you wanna generate`, then, after a while, It will output a model called `model.m`. and you can use this model to crack the other CAPTCHA

for the variable, I recommend you to input 1000-2000, it will make a 94% rate of accuracy model.



## TODO

change a better arithmetic to increase the accuracy,

and change the generate construction to speed up the training time
